//Central processing Unit(Motherboard)
//The processor has two unit the arithematic logical and control unit
//Ram Slot=stores data while the processor is excecuted
//Buses which are used t communicate with cpu
//Computer SMPS = regulates the power supply of the system
//Hard Disc= used for permanent storage of data

//c is a compiler based language and also high level programming language
//Program is a set of instruction given to the computer to perform specific task in specific language
//Collection of program is know as software
//System software is a piece of software that helps to manage different devices.
// So system software acts as an intermediary between the user and the different hardware devices. 
//Application software for specicfic tasks onlu
//Operating System= a layer of software interposed between the application program aand the hardware also now as resource manager

//************************************************************************************************************
//How are Programs excecuted
/*Types of memory:- 
1. Volatile (Ram){Stays till the power supply is going off}
2. Non-Volatile (Hardisc)*/

//Cpu - Memory(ram) - disk | copilation}operating system contains all the things
//Disk(program)->Program gets loaded into ram(MEmory)->Program is executed on cpu
//Program under Exceution is known as a Process

//An algorithm is a collection of finite unambigous steps to solve a computational problem
//Principle of any programming language:-
/* 1.Sequencing -> Executng a set of statements in a sequential order
   2.Decision making -> Choosing from many alternatives
   3.Repetition -> one or group of statements in a loop, iteratively
